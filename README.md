# MNDR Lighting

## About

The Rainbroz collaborated with MNDR to create a LED light show that fed off her music and augmented her live show.

The setup is an Arduino and individually-addressable strips of LEDs from Adafruit. MIDI information is sent from the audio gear to trigger different scenes within the Arduino. Each scene is a series of LED timings that work cohesively with the music.

The Arduino is self-contained. That is, no computer is used to control the Arduino.
